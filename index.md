      <h3>Engineer|Researcher</h3>
      I am currently looking for a research opportunity in the field of Artificail Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have completed my under-graduation course in Electronics and Communication at Visvesvaraya Technological University(VTU). During this time, I greatly enjoyed courses such as Signal and Systems, Digital Signal Processing,Programming in C, Computer Communication Networks and Microprocessors & Controllers that allowed me to utilize my prowess in problem-solving to tackle complex problems. My final year thesis project titled "Smart Pregnancy Detection for Cow Using MATLAB" under the guidance of Associate Professor Prasanna Kumar C. I got to apply my knowledge of Digital Signal Processing and got a chance to learn and explore on machine learning. I am also proud of the fact that my work has been accepted and published under the same name in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Engineering and Science (IJES). Apart from this, As a RPA engineer at Novigo Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I got an opportunity to work and research in Cognitive Automation. To learn more on machine learning and to have strong foundation, I have taken up and acompleted a course on Machine Learning fron coursera. Now, with a strong foundation I want to explore more in the field of machine learning specifically in unsupervised learning and artificial intelligence specifically in computer vision for which I seek a full time research in this domain.
